## 1. Executive Summary  
**LiberProtocol** is a decentralized social network built on blockchain technology, designed to empower users with full ownership of their digital identity and content. By leveraging **NFT domains** (e.g., `.eth`, `.crypto`), decentralized storage (IPFS, Arweave), and community governance (DAO), LiberProtocol aims to redefine social media as a user-owned, censorship-resistant ecosystem.  

**Key Innovations**:  
- Self-sovereign identity via NFT domains.  
- Content permanence through decentralized storage.  
- Tokenized governance ($LIBER token).  
- Interoperability with Web3 applications.  

---

## 2. Problem Statement  
### Centralized Social Media Challenges:  
- **Data Ownership**: Platforms monetize user data without sharing profits.  
- **Censorship**: Content removal based on opaque policies.  
- **Fragmentation**: Profiles and followers are locked to specific platforms.  
- **Security Risks**: Centralized servers are prone to breaches.  

---

## 3. Solution Overview  
LiberProtocol addresses these challenges through:  
- **NFT-Based Identity**: Users own their profiles as transferable NFT domains.  
- **Decentralized Storage**: Content is stored on IPFS/Arweave, ensuring immutability.  
- **DAO Governance**: Community-driven moderation and platform upgrades.  
- **Web3 Integration**: Direct interaction with wallets, NFTs, and dApps.
